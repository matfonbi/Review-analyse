{"author": "user_10", "source": "fnac", "message": "Truly worth the money spent! Even if you go broke!. My honest review after going broke buying this depreciating object.I have been using android phones since the last 10 years and finally decided to switch to iPhone! I used to roast iPhone for its prices, lack of features and also things like power adapter not given in box etc, but my last android phone (iqoo 7 legend) had lot of software related issues and battery issues after updating it to android 12, tired of bugs and software glitches in android, I finally decided to buy a iPhone and switch from android to iOS And Boy Was I right!I never even held an iPhone In my life before because of its price, but now I made a great choice even if I had to spend all my savings on it.iPhone 13 is so smooth that even my IQOO 7 Legend with 120hz feels slower than it even if iPhone has only 60hz. And I can’t believe what I’m seeing, all the games/apps are so much smoother and optimised than on android.I was very sceptical about the charging speed of an iPhone Because in Iqoo I had 66w fast charger where as for iPhone I had to buy 20w separate fast charger for 1800rs, but charging speed isn’t disappointing.Display quality is truly flagship level and I’m quite a fan of the small 6.1 display believe it or not, being able to reach the top of display with just one hand is very helpful, Build quality is great.I would recommend NOT to waste extra 40k for buying 13 pro. Because I don’t think having a extra camera telephoto lens is worth spending 40k.You can see in the 3rd image attached the quality of wide angle camera pic shot on my iPhone 13, wide angle camera struggles in low light, but main camera is really good, captures true colours. Front camera is really good too, truly flagship.Speakers are Great.Battery life is better than my previous devices,iOS is very optimised in terms of battery life, easy 8hrs sot on normal usage.NOTE : While playing BGMI you loose around 2% battery every 6minutes at HD + Extreme Graphics. Which is also good. Pro Max Would Be far better in terms of battery.For the software? Yes I feel like there are few downsides, even if the software is very smooth and has very less bugs, it has two annoying things : any game gets paused when you open control centre just to check the battery etc, Lock Screen is annoying and also having to reach the top left corner just to see notifications is also annoying, clearing all notifications is also very annoying.But other than that a perfect 10/10 purchase. I was very disappointed at myself when I paid for the iPhone but when I received it I was truly happy that I bought it.Truly worth it.", "sentiment_label": "positive", "sentiment_score": 1.0, "created_at": "2022-06-02T00:00:00", "country": "Germany"}

Performance: This is where the phone shines, you can throw any app available on the App store and it will run it without breaking a sweat.5. Face Id works like charm, it's the best biometric phone lock out there undoubtedly.Things I wish were better:1. Battery life would have been better, I get up to 4.30 - 5 Hours SOT with mixed usage (high brightness, 1 hour calls, 2-3 hour social media, and 2 hour media playback/music)2. Charges Slow compared to my earlier Samsung. Takes almost 1.2 Hours from 20% to 80%3. Front camera is average, it fails to get correct skin tones and lighting. I keep it on default and still it produces over saturated photos.4. Dialer / phone app sucks. I am someone who makes up to 200 calls a day due to nature of my SCM work.

Cost is wall for me. - The photos are nice and feature like exposure adjust and filter was good and quality photos . And the 5x zoomed photos is not good for me.it reduced the pixel quality .- The video and optical image stabilisation was mind blowing . i mostly explore on videos . it was soo good , no words other than that.AND THE BIGGEST FEAR FOR ME NOW IS IOS UPDATEi turned off the auto update at first place .i heared about DISPLAY ISSUES,HEATING ISSUES and BUGS in the ios updates for 13 and 14 series.So for expencive and established brand like apple does not fair .

So will be dividing this into the pros and negs:Product red 128GBPros:1) Received genuine product from Amazon( was quite sceptic about it though)2) Built quality excellent3) Camera quality excellent. True to life color reproduction, Indoor conditions amazing, night photos are good, facial tones are very good, day clicks are amazing. In short it's an amazing exp. Selfie cam also produces very good quality images. And also no shift in dynamic range while shifting B/W wide and ultra wide cams.4) Display:- Its a really great display, not 120 hz, but the experience is no less than a 120 hz, coz of apple's great software optimization, buttery smooth, no jitters on the screen, won't feel like a 60 hz panel. Now the notch, yes it will be bothering a little bit but its got its own functions, face unlock and stuff (works great in all environmental conditions)after a little while you get adjusted and it got its own magic functions like when when the phone rings and you go close to it, it detects your presence and lowers the vol level.5) Performance: Most powerful processor in the world.6) Battery:- With light usage will easily go for 2 days and with heavy 1 day. Remember to follow a charging pattern and it will give a solid battery exp.7) Speakers: Very loud with a small thumpCons:1) To keep photos and stuff you need to buy storage. 5 GB by default but that's nothing. Download google photos as an alternate sol. if you don't wanna buy storage.2) File management system sucks, android is much better.3) It has dolby atmos but for that you need a subscription to Apple music.4) Does not have a telephoto cam, which I think is a must at this price point.5) Somehow I am not getting 4g+ on my airtel, don't know why but in my android phone always used to get that.6) No USB C7) Siri is dumb AF8) Apple maps are not good, so download Google maps.9) Google keypad is much better than apple's.10) Notification panel and those small things like typing in the notification panel and other things that you can do in android is much much better than apple.11) As of now no haptic feedback while typing maybe coming on IOS 16Note:- Apple ecosystem still exploring that part but whenever you click any pic it automatically gets updated and I can see it in my Macbook also.Overall I would say if you are planning to buy a phone for responsiveness and does the everyday stuff without any hanging problems and stuff then buy it, and also if you are planning to keep it for a long time, then I think its a good investment for the future. Its got Great resale value.Hope this helps in making your decision easier.Update after 2 weeks of usage:All the above points remains the same, but I did check out the ecosystem and the experience has been amazing.1) I can receive and make phone calls (cellular calls) from my macbook, and the call quality is also good.So basically you can keep your phone in some other section of the house and you are working with your macbook somewhere else and if some call comes you can receive that on your macbook. PS:- your phone and macbook should be connected to a similar network, i.e wi-fi.2) Airplay- Just from the lock screen itself i can play any video and also listen to music from my phone. So basically you can watch youtube amazon prime videos(app not in the macbook but present on phone) and other stuff and also listen to music, and the switch of devices is also seamless. So someone in my house can use my macbook to watch movies on amazon prime(playing from my phone) and I can browse linkedin or FB from my iphone.", "sentiment_label": "positive", "sentiment_score": 0.8, "created_at": "2022-07-30T00:00:00", "country": "Canada"}

This looks premium not just because of its branding, it has everything which makes it feel premium. However, despite all the looks and finish, the transition from Android to Apple is not very smooth and you may constantly lack certain features that can make life easy. I was using vivo y19 Lite before this and still have that phone with me. Putting out the feature that is being missed by me-1. Forwarding Anything in Whatsapp: Forwarding anything in Whatsapp from IPhone takes bit more step as compared to what is being offered in Android. This makes the entire process slow for an Android User2. App Switcher: Apple could have easily made App Switcher easy with just light Swipe up, instead they made it with long pressed Swipe up. Why man, why.. You don't have any features for Swipe up, just make it easy to launch.3. Andorid Dialer is Always Missed: Every android has a basic feature, where you can search the contact directly from Phone Dialer, here Dialer is used for Dialing Number only and it will not suggest you similar contact from contacts or last Dial. This is really bad.. If you have to Dial a number directly, use Dialer.. If you have to dial someone from Recent Call log, shift to that and if you to dial someone from contact, shift to that. Man, all this can be done under one button, under dialer. Android user will miss this very badly.4. Sending Multiple Files in Whatsapp: If you wants to add more than 1 file directly from whatsapp, you have to do it twice. In Android, one can simple start selecting from whatspp itself and can select as many files as they wants and can send in a single click. Here for sending multiple files, you have to go to gallery or folder and select all files first and share it through whatsapp.5. No Swipe based shifting from Chats to Status and to calls: In Android Whatsapp, you can switch between Calls, Chats and Status by just swiping, here you have to press button of each.6. Contact Viewing: Contact list sorting method is still out of my mind. Man, make it easy. For example, if one of your contacts First Name or Middle Name or Last Name, any one of thing start with Alphabet \"A\", than it will be shown on top of the list. Apple, pls adopt any one method or at least allow us to customise it.7. Many Apps in Android are much more refined than its version on Apple.8. This is for those who had use Samsung Pay: Samsung Pay was one of the best app for making UPI or Card Payment, just swipe up from home screen of Samsung Phones (Only S Series) and the app is open for payment, I miss that here very badly.9. Lack of Dual Messenger Facility: You can't use two different WhatsApp numbers here in the same phone, as supported in all android right now.These are the issues that I face right now. Apart from this, the phone is good, the sound is loud and clear, it Feels Premium in Hand, the Touch is very good and Face ID works like a charm.

The product I received was genuine, and the camera is absolutely lovely, capturing moments with stunning clarity and vividness. Overall, the iPhone 13 delivers a significant upgrade over my previous Android device, and although I was initially skeptical about downgrading from a 120Hz display to 60Hz, the phone's performance feels far from clunky or sluggish.The camera system on the iPhone 13 is nothing short of impressive. It produces stunning images, offering a level of detail and color accuracy.In terms of performance, the iPhone 13 truly shines. Its powerful A15 Bionic chip ensures smooth multitasking, seamless app navigation, and impressive gaming experiences. The device feels snappy and responsive, effortlessly handling resource-intensive tasks. I appreciate the optimized performance that comes with the iPhone 13.Now, let's address the issue that left me somewhat disappointed—the packaging. Considering the price tag of 61,000 INR, one would expect more attention to be paid to the packaging. Unfortunately, the phone arrived in a flimsy packet, which had clearly been subjected to the challenges of long-distance transportation. The iPhone box itself was damaged, but luckily, the phone inside was unharmed. It's disheartening to see such carelessness from the seller Appario Retail when it comes to packaging such an expensive device.

I purchased this at best price , when it's delivered there is no issue found in this product. No scratches and no cracks fully new and genuine product given by Amazon!!! When I checked after getting delivery all things are working perfectly fine 🙂 but after a day I updated my iphone so after I found an camera issue ( camera is shaking [ Rear Camera ] so guys I tried to replace the product but Amazon tolds me I have to go first in iPhone main showroom for diagnosis! Amazon just told me to go apple shop and told him what is happening with the phone , and if they deny to repair the product then I have to ask for (Denial report) so I firstly go in iVenus (apple authorised service centre) but they give me a job sheet not denial report but they refused to repair as well! Then after I go in Mumbai (Apple BKC) for service apple BKC is main showroom of iphone where they are very professional and talk in very fluent English as well! So they took my product for the repair then they took around 19 days to repair or replace the parts of my iphone !!! They replaced (Camera) but they also replaced Battery I asked why they replaced Battery so they told me some scratches on battery because they need to replace the battery !!!

{"author": "user_256", "source": "amazon", "message": "Good phone. I’m not a phone fanatic but here is my simple and honest review.As someone who has only used windows and android phones I must say, iPhone is a good upgrade. I do, however, have some issues with the phone. If you are a hard core android user then you WILL face some issues. As in, the fact that iPhone does not have built in call recording feature. In the case of messages, you can reply from the drawer itself but does not have mark as read option. Truecaller absolutely does not work in this phone. I am a premium member on truecaller and it is of no use cause i still get bombarded with spam calls. Dual sim is one nano sim and the other e-sim, no dual tray for both your sim card. I am having issues with screencast/mirroring as well. In short, all the small little things that seems normal and one’s that you’re used to in an android is basically missing in an iPhone. Other than that the phone is great. Camera is great with a lot of features (which I’m still learning). Sound is great. No annoying nudges to keep updating apps. It’ll silently update in the background without the prompt message that it is being updated. Easy to use once you get the hang of it.Update:- i have been using this phone since March’23 so it’s been 2 months now and I have found that this phone is starting to lag a little. Not much, just a little but it is annoying (having spent so much money you’d expect more). Also, even with full network bars i sometimes struggle to get net connection. I have to rely on wifi most of the times and it has become a burden.", "sentiment_label": "positive", "sentiment_score": 1.0, "created_at": "2023-10-04T00:00:00", "country": "Italy"}

I am using for more than a month and it never hanged.4. Updated to IOS 16 and unlike Android phones it is bug free or has very less bugs5. Long term software & security support (a very few Android phone manufacturers gives 5 years OS support with less bugs)6. Consistent camera. I would say the camera is not so hi fi but takes consistently good photos7. Apps are well optimized. Even google apps like YouTube, Maps, Gmail etc works better in IOS rather than their own proprietary OS8. Widgets in IOS 15 and 16. Android has widgets for decades now but IOS took the user experience to a whole new level.9. The new boxy design (introduced with iPhone 12) is cool and looks good.10. Network & call quality is good.11. Haptic feedback is awesome.Dislikes (Some dislikes are due to myself being an Android user for decades)1. The ugly notch. Though they made a dynamic island with iPhone 14 but lets accept the truth its still ugly compared to the hole punch2. Battery life & charging speed.3. Lack of customization. I can’t place the icons wherever i feel like on the screen.4. Lack of fingerprint scanner. Face id is good but fingerprint scanner is more practical, specially when you pay contactless5. Being an Android user I am used to with swipe from the right edge of the screen to go back. In iPhone this is not working & you need to reach out to actual back buttons of the app.6. Settings app is messy as all installed app would show up on the main page. I would say Android settings app is more sophisticated.7. Lastly the price should’ve been less. With all discounts & all it comes ~60k INR and its costly.Overall I am satisfied switching to iPhone 13 from Android (used OnePlus 6t for 3 years). Last time I switched to iPhone was with iPhone 5S and I couldn’t stay for 6 months and switched to Android again.

{"author": "user_400", "source": "ebay", "message": "It is a total waste of money!. Things to remember before you buy an Iphone -1) It is good only untill its warranty is there, for extended warranty, it is 10k approx for one year.2) Under warranty also, it's resell value is only 25k in Apple store, so this itself explains that the mobile is over-priced, and that's why resell value under warranty is 25k which is it's actual value.3) Once the warranty expires - Apple will keep on bringing in updated versions and the updated versions will mall function in a 1 year old Iphone as well. Problems include - Green screen, network issues, etc.4) Many people Iphones underwent Green Screen after the latest update and as their Iphone was not under warranty had to spend 400$ or 11k to 15k depending upon their model for screen repair or change. Meaning Apple company will release update, because of which the Iphone will malfunction and people have to spend money inorder to repair it.5) Iphone - covers, tampered glass are all very expensive and are of third class quality and design. Even after spending 1500 to 2000 INR for an Iphone cover, it will last only for 6-8 months. After that, either it will become dull, dirty or look ugly or pale. An android cover of 250 Rs also functions the same way.6) Apps - That is a total scam everyone knows that. You have to pay for many apps and many apps are still unavailable in App StoreMoral of the story -You can buy an expensive Iphone and use it comfortable for a year or maximum 2. So, if you are ready to spend so much money just for a year, it is the best mobile. For long run, this is just a scam that it will last for a long run.Joke of the year - You will be prompted with features that Iphone and Macbook's only have! - The only issue is, comman man never uses those features!

Though the screen size could have been bigger.4)Charging is fast as compared to other 20W charging phones.5) Good face unlock feature.6) Great picture quality tho there are some problems i have discussed in cons.6) feels and looks premiumCons:-1) Not android friendly. If u are switching from android, u will find it very difficult to use.2) Sells by the name of privacy, but no privacy features like app lock, lock during calls is available.3) Few apps stop working very often.

{"author": "user_458", "source": "reddit", "message": "The iPhone 13 is the new benchmark for flagship phones...!. We're pretty confident when we say that the iPhone 13 is the best iPhone for most people. It may look like Apple has only changed the position of one of the phone's back cameras since last year's model, but trust us when we say that there are more substantial upgrades than that. With a new display, larger battery, and better camera hardware and software, the iPhone 13 is the new benchmark for flagship phones.Once again, Apple's made the iPhone 13 far more powerful than its Android competitors thanks to its 5G-ready A15 Bionic chip. If the raw performance doesn't interest you, photographers can play with the new Photographic Style filters in the camera app, while videographers will be excited by the new Cinematic mode focus-racking ability.The regular iPhone 13 has some flaws. The charging is still relatively slow compared to some Android phones. And I don't like that only the iPhone 13 Pro models get a 120Hz display and telephoto zoom. But based on my in-depth iPhone 13 review, this new iPhone is the best phone for the money.The overall display quality continues to be stellar. When watching the trailer for The Matrix Resurrections, I was mesmerized by the neon code encircling Neo as he walked down the street, and in another scene, I could make out individual hairs on Neo’s beard as he stared up into the sun.DISPLAY1. Smaller notch makes the display a bit more immersive2. Slightly different button placement3. Pink and blue are standout colors4. New Green color launched March 2022CAMERA1. Bright and colorful images beat Samsung2. Ultra-wide camera delivers more scenes and improved Night mode3. Photographic styles give you creative controlVIDEO1. Cinematic mode automatically changes focus on subjects while adding bokeh2. Superior Dolby Vision HDR video qualityPERFORMANCE and A15 Bionic1.A15 Bionic is the fastest chip once again2. Machine learning performance notably betterBATTERY LIFE1.10 hours and 33 minutes of battery life, which is 2 hours better than the iPhone 12Software1.SharePlay lets you watch videos and listen to music with friends2. Focus cuts down on distractionsVERDICT :The iPhone 13 improves on what was already the best iPhone for most people by introducing a bunch of welcome enhancements. I especially like the longer battery life, as the iPhone 12’s endurance was underwhelming even for a 5G phone. I wouldn’t recommend that iPhone 12 owners upgrade to the new iPhone, but the iPhone 13 is worth it if you own an iPhone 11 or older device.I don’t think many people will care about the smaller notch. What truly stands out on the iPhone 13 is the camera. The low-light performance is even better now, and computational photography features like Cinematic mode and Photographic styles flex the A15 Bionic’s muscles in ways that go way beyond benchmarks.I’m also glad Apple doubled the starting storage at 128GB, as that move was overdue and puts the new iPhone on par with Android flagships. I’d like to see Apple offering faster charging next time around — be it via USB-C or MagSafe — as well as a 120Hz display.The bottom line is that the iPhone 13 is a fantastic phone and raises the bar for what you think a camera phone can do.", "sentiment_label": "positive", "sentiment_score": 1.0, "created_at": "2022-07-27T00:00:00", "country": "USA"}

But anyone with an iPhone 11 or older will find enough new parts and features to consider the new modelsScreenThe screen is notably better than last year's. It's the first iPhone with Apple's ProMotion display, a very high refresh-rate screen technology that was introduced on the iPad Pro in 2017.The screen can adjust to the content on the page to help save battery life and make things feel smoother. If you're just reading a website, for example, it might refresh less frequently and save battery life. But then if you're gaming or scrolling through a long webpage, it'll refresh really fast to make everything much smoother.BatteryBattery life is top-notch and lasts longer than any other iPhone on the market. Unless you're playing games for hours and hoursThat's thanks to a combination of a newer processor, a new screen and a bigger battery. I streamed nine hours of movies, for example, with just over 50% brightness, and still had more than half the battery left.CameraThe regular wide-angle, the zoom and the ultra-wide-angle lenses on the back now allow in more light, which means they're better at taking pictures in the dark.The HDR feature is also better in situations where your subject might have a lot of light behind them, which can normally make people in a picture look dark — all the iPhone 13 phones can keep color and detail even if the sun is right behind someone.You can get really close to an object, like a blueberry or a flower, and capture a lot of detail.", "sentiment_label": "positive", "sentiment_score": 1.0, "created_at": "2021-09-25T00:00:00", "country": "Spain"}

The phone in itself is so smooth and it’s so easy to edit videos or reels as no lagging is there.While the experience of switching from android to iOS was great, but there are so many things which are way more complicated in iOS.I can’t use true-caller and have to manually check the number, no headphone jack and airpods are kinda not useful for someone who talks for long hours on calls. (Planning to get the lightning cable wired apple earphones).Also, the fact that it does not have fingerprint is kinda shocking as phones starting from 10k also have that feature now, guess apple should really look in to it.Overall, I feel the pros outweigh the cons.Lastly, the BEST feature is the camera.

{"author": "user_706", "source": "ebay", "message": "There is almost no difference between the iPhone 13 and 14 (although they cannot be considered refurbished).. The problem with refurbished products is the appearance and especially the battery. In the first place, users consider replacing their battery when it is around 80%, so no one wants to buy one with the same 80% battery. The lifespan of an iPhone is considered to be between 80% (0) and 100% (20) (within the range of 20). If it arrives at 80%, it cannot be said to be refurbished. Even when buying or reselling used iPhones, except for new ones, they have a maximum charge of 70-80%. Therefore, the way to distinguish between bad and good dealers is mostly determined by the scratches on the exterior and the battery capacity. Incidentally, the usage time at 70% is around 4 hours 70% to 100% (↓) time with maximum load 80% usage time is around 6 hours (maximum charging time generally recommended for replacing) 90% usage time is more than 9 hours 100% usage time is more than 11 hours [Those that do not last half a day are likely to cause stress] I was debating between the 13 and the 14, and I bought the 13, and it was the right decision. The price had come down quite a bit, so I thought there might be differences, but the performance was exactly the same. The only difference was whether the number of cores was one more or one less, and there was almost no difference in terms of operation. There are probably only darker and lighter color variations, but it doesn't seem like an upgrade. The operation is sluggish on both the 13 and 14, and it feels like scrolling (screen movement) doesn't slide.

{"author": "user_947", "source": "ebay", "message": "iPhone XR to iPhone 15. Just made the transition and here’s my POV on the first ~2 month of usePros- Battery Life is awesome, easily get about a day plus on this, so no Compliants- Screen fluidity is smooooooth! Understandable as I’m transitioning into an OLED from LCD in XR. The panel gets a solid peak brightness quotient so happy here- Screen brightness is good as compared to XR, 2200 nits, but I hardly go beyond 30% brightness to save some juice. Whilst outside I did crank it up and it’s spotless- Dynamic Island is fun, yet to use it to the fullest. Like the way it shows the ETA on delivery and Uber. Simple solution instead of you having to get into the app to check on the ETA- Weight, this phone is soo bloody light!! Understandable as XR was a brick, this is soo welcome- Camera is awesome, love the 48MP intervention, the portrait mode and cinematic mode does the job for me.- The Apple eco system, I enjoy seamless integration of my Watch, Mac, IPad Air and IPhone- Apples approach on Security!- Transferring data from my XR to 15 using the built in app is flawlessCons- The phone was over heating , there is a solution to this from Apple = back up the phone and then erase and reset the phone… including your eSIM settings.. once done set up the phone with the back up….. works like a charm- I still believe Apple should have thrown in a charging brick with such purchasesIndustry memes- USB C : honestly don’t give a jack for the reviews out there on this. It’s just a mode of charging for me and that’s it. I’m not going to be transferring any data so yea, 2.0 speed yadadada - thank you so much- Blue is not blue but white! Think people whining about this should go back to 13/14 or those ludicrous blues in Androids!! These are pestle shades people!!- Buying an Apple product to show off!! I mean, you even serious? You buy a product and then comment on why you should not buy one?- 60hz refresh rate for a 80k phone : save your jokes people, there are many of us who appreciate quality and security than how the screen refreshes. For non gamers like me, panel that is here is apt. I’ve seen a ton of folks buying 120hz phones and using it only to make calls, watch some videos and for textingTips of managing battery health- Switch off background app refresh for apps you don’t need back ground refresh- Avoid wireless charging as this heats your devise up- I charge my phone only using a power bank  not direct wired or wireless charging- Don’t let the battery go below 20%, keep it always between 95% and 20%- Switch off location services and allow only certain app that needs your location service- Switch on Charging Optimisation under the battery section- I don’t use vibrate mode for rings/incoming calls etc- My XR after 5 years of use has 86% battery health so I guess I know what I’m recommending aboveVendor Experience : Appario Retail Private Limited. 5/5, been a regular customer and they have never disappointed me even once. The purchase experience is breezy and quick, thanks team for the support and look forward to the collaboration in the future.….. watch out for this space.

The display is impressively bright, despite the 60 Hz, which I thought might be a drawback coming from a 120 Hz Android device. Surprisingly, it feels the same. The battery life is solid, providing around 1.5 days for mild phone users. As a developer, with light usage for content consumption and social media, I get around 8 hours of screen on time with 25-30% battery left. It charges quickly to 50% and then trickle charges to 100%, adapting to usage patterns for faster charging. Initially, there were some battery drain and heating issues, but they resolved as the phone learned my usage patterns.Now, the camera is impressive, especially in low light conditions. Despite lacking a dedicated long exposure mode, the default night option, averaging around 3 seconds, captures details even in the dark. Compared to the iPhone 14 and S21FE, the camera quality is top-notch. The auto portrait detection is a standout feature. Believe me no one explain the real use of that auto portrait theoretically until you try it.In terms of network, the dual 5G standby supports Vi and JIO 5G (eSim). Inside my house, I get around 500 Mbps, and outside easily surpass 1 Gbps. Call quality is excellent, with two introduced modes in the mic option available in the control center.This is my personal opinion; I'll update if I find anything noteworthy.", "sentiment_label": "positive", "sentiment_score": 1.0, "created_at": "2023-03-12T00:00:00", "country": "Germany"}

That tomorrow became 2 days, after lot of phone calls with Amazon and emails to and fro on 2nd attempt The rabbit exchange app that Amazon is mandating for exchange passed all the test (including battery at 80% life).

No shortcut to change between vibration and no vibration frequently.2. No end call button on the lock screen.3. Call list is nonsense. It shows phone, whatsap and all other calls in same list.4. Go to a specific contact in call history n you can see only history of one day. Total length of call history is 100. Most probably you will not be able to find call history of previous week for a specific contact.5. Need of Itunes to copy music from PC to phone.6. No file manager like android where we can see and access complete folder structure.7. No silent and vibrate mode notification on screen.8. Need to buy separate adapter n earphones after already spending double.9. Cannot remove torch icon in iphone14 from lock screen. You may end up switching it on unwillingly.10. BT and WiFi shortcuts will just disconnect them. To turn off you need to go to Settings screen and turn it off again.11. In so many places, either text or files, there is no Select All option. (I'm waiting for android users to get all pics received in whatsapp after a trip).12. Takes a lot of time to get detected by devices when hotspot is on.13. At some screen you get stuck and you will miss the back button.14. Copy some mp3 files to your iphone and you will never be able to find it with default music app.15. Every app will be either on lot of home screens or organised under some groups. You will never get a clean home screen with 2 or 3 most frequently used apps and all other apps in a swipe up menu like android.16. No fingerprint sensor.Adding to the list after using for 2 months:17. Cannot turn off camera shutter sound in general mode.18. No option to flag contact as spam/scam.19. If you connect wireless BT device, it won't show battery percentage of BT device.20. You get a notification while using phone and you miss to open it, then you will not see it until you remember yourself to open notification screen. Notification icons won't be pinned on top of the screen like Android.21. If you use 2 SIM and want to switch mobile data between SIMs, there is no shortcut than going to Settings screen. Also, cannot see current amount of data used or left.List goes on and on, try it yourself.. No iphone owner speaks about limitations. Some people like iphone for these and others hate it for these. If you can pay double and handle these adjustments with work arounds, go ahead. Once you unlock and give your phone to someone, or once you give access permissions to apps, even iphone is not most secure. Fr example, If you are driving and someone wants to use your phone for music/maps etc., then you have to give your password, because there is no fingerprint option and face recogniton feature will become dangerous option.", "sentiment_label": "neutral", "sentiment_score": 0.6, "created_at": "2023-06-06T00:00:00", "country": "India"}

Something I like about this phone is its fast speed along with the different options the camera gives you. I wouldn't say the iPhone 14 has a better camera than the 13, rather I think they are more similar and there wasn't a dramatic improvement. The battery life is something that I wish was a little longer. It last about an hour or two more than the average iPhone 13, but does charge faster. I have been able to receive about a 50% charge in 30 minutes. Another great feature of this phone is the painless eSIM setup. Being able to set up the SIM card virtually and not a physical transfer on your phone makes carrying over carriers from phone to phone much easier. battery lasts as long as the iPhone 13. As you may remember, it was much better than the iPhone 12. The iPhone 14 is a smooth, responsive phone and great for high-quality gaming or photo and video editing.

I wanted the midnight variant in the regular size. It looks so sleek in person. Yes it is glossy and a finger-print magnet but I'll have to bear with it coz I simply like black phones. It's working perfectly. Also, i would like to add, the packing of such an expensive device was not up to the mark. I have seen how well Apple packs the box and ships to its customers in videos of people from other countries. The Amazon seller just put it in a large plastic bag. Though the box was unharmed when it reached me, I could still notice a little dented corners on the box, which could have been avoided if they had packed the box in a bigger carton with foams.", "sentiment_label": "positive", "sentiment_score": 1.0, "created_at": "2023-05-21T00:00:00", "country": "France"}

I have had this iPhone for 38 days.It has the worst battery life of any iPhone I've ever owned, and I have owned ONLY iPhones since the first version was released 17 years ago.This is the second iPhone 14 that I've bought from the renewed store .The first one I bought on December 4th, 2023, and I could not have been happier with the phone.It arrived in brand new condition, and performed flawlessly.On the recommendation of a friend, I checked the battery health and charging after having it for MONTHS and it was at 100%! I was thrilled!I absolutely loved the phone!I never had a single problem with it.Unfortunately, on July 30 of this year I dropped it, and it was beyond repair.I immediately went back to the Amazon renewed store and purchased another iPhone 14 because my experience with the first one was so fantastic.It arrived in new looking condition, exactly like the one I bought in December 2023.It was not scratched or anything really noticeable, it just seemed to be \"worn\" a little bit, but I fully understood that it was a renewed phone, and any cosmetic issues were not that important to me, including the color, which, when my iPhone is in its case, you cannot tell what color it is anyway.Unfortunately, I DID NOT look at the battery health and charging when I first got the phone 38 days ago, but I did look at it about two weeks ago, and it said 93%.I thought, ok, it's a renewed phone, it's not going to have 100% battery life.I can live with that.Well, I just looked at it today and it's now at 90% battery health and charging.So this phone is dying quickly.After being fully charged it dies within hours.I have it completely set up for optimized battery life.I have lost emails and messages that I was in the middle of composing, and the phone just dies.I've been in the middle of important phone calls when the phone dies, simply because I had just fully charged it a few hours before that, and thought I would be fine for hours to come.I just had a total shoulder replacement surgery a week ago, and I was on the phone with my doctors office yesterday about my first post-op appointment, and my phone died in the middle of it.I thought I had HOURS left before the phone would die.Then I had to plug it in, and wait for it to come back alive, so I could call my doctor back and hopefully not wait a half hour after losing my place in line.On top of that is also has issues with the touchscreen being glitchy, and sometimes I have to tap on things several times to get them to work.As I said, I have been an iPhone owner/user since the very first version came out 17 years ago.I've always loved all my iPhones, and I will continue to be an iPhone user for the rest of my life.This is in no way reflection on Apple iPhones whatsoever.They are an amazing and fantastic piece of technology.I think I just got a bad one for the first time in my life.Luckily, I have just checked and I have until November 6th to return this phone, and I WILL be returning it.The problem is, what do I do in the meantime?Am I expected to buy a new one and get that shipped to me, transfer all my information from this phone to the new one, and then return this one?That is extremely hard to do financially!I am actually still paying for this phone on my Amazon Prime American Express card!Or, do I return this phone and wait until the refund has been issued and then buy another phone? Then wait until that is sent to me.I would not have a phone for at least a week in the interim, and we all know these days that's a practical impossibility.I am also having several medical issues.Like I said, I just had a total shoulder replacement surgery last Monday, September 9th, and have several upcoming follow up appointments, and physical therapy appointments.I also have several other non-related medical issues that definitely require that I have a phone.I just don't know what to do.", "sentiment_label": "negative", "sentiment_score": 0.2, "created_at": "2024-09-19T00:00:00", "country": "China"}

UPDATE: After speaking to a very helpful agent at Loop Mobile, the company who deals with these refurbishments, I discovered my phone was still under warranty and they would replace for free. However I needed to send my phone in first, before they would ship me a new one. I use my phone for work so this is a problem, but I can make it work for a few days. I'm told the turnaround is very fast too, so I figure I'm looking at a week maximum.Due to a tracking error on FedEx's end, it takes them longer to process my return, so it's nearly a week and a half before I get my new phone. And then when I get it, it's set up for TMobile, not AT&T so I can't even use it. And all attempts to call this week have been met with a message of \"no available agents, call back later\". They have been relatively fast to respond via email, but honestly, this has been such a mess I'm wishing I had just spent some extra money for a new phone. I know there is always a risk with refurb items, but I've rarely had issue and when I do they are resolved quickly.I purchased a refurbished iPhone 14 in August of last year and it was working great with no issues. It was a like new phone. However, in the last few days I've started getting \"Unknown Battery\" messages and my phone will turn off at random multiple times throughout the day, to the point where I don't feel confident making phone calls with the phone for fear of them being dropped.I went back to the order to see what my options were in terms of warranty and tech support, and it's EXTREMELY convoluted. It's hard for me to even tell if I qualify for the 90 day guarantee or the 1 year, because my phone was classified as \"new\" but the Amazon site only lists guarantees for conditions which are premium, excellent, or acceptable. When I tried to chat with someone I found my message was sent over to Loop Mobile, who must be the third party company who actually refurbished the phone. But it's unclear who I need to contract to see how to get this fixed or if I just need to pay out of pocket.

It’s crazy how much has changed—face ID feels like magic, and the battery life is a dream compared to my old 5s, which needed a charger practically glued to it.If you’re thinking about upgrading, especially if you’re coming from a much older model like I was, don’t hesitate.

Solid Build Quality and very polished software (compared to Samsung's One UI)2. Camera:-Rear: Rear camera is pretty decent with good color accuracy in all lighting conditions. Videos are steady and smooth.3. Mic / Speakers: Mic is exceptionally well, isolates all background sounds in noisy situations. Speakers are crisp with good bass.4. Performance: This is where the phone shines, you can throw any app available on the App store and it will run it without breaking a sweat.5. Face Id works like charm, it's the best biometric phone lock out there undoubtedly.Things I wish were better:1. Battery life would have been better, I get up to 4.30 - 5 Hours SOT with mixed usage (high brightness, 1 hour calls, 2-3 hour social media, and 2 hour media playback/music)2. Charges Slow compared to my earlier Samsung. Takes almost 1.2 Hours from 20% to 80%3. Front camera is average, it fails to get correct skin tones and lighting. I keep it on default and still it produces over saturated photos.4. Dialer / phone app sucks. I am someone who makes up to 200 calls a day due to nature of my SCM work. Dialer on Samsung is far better. For unknown call you can add a note to the number in Samsung and it reflect when the person call you again, without having to save unnecessary contacts.

Cost is wall for me. - The photos are nice and feature like exposure adjust and filter was good and quality photos .

Things to remember before you buy an Iphone -1) It is good only untill its warranty is there, for extended warranty, it is 10k approx for one year.2) Under warranty also, it's resell value is only 25k in Apple store, so this itself explains that the mobile is over-priced, and that's why resell value under warranty is 25k which is it's actual value.3) Once the warranty expires - Apple will keep on bringing in updated versions and the updated versions will mall function in a 1 year old Iphone as well. Problems include - Green screen, network issues, etc.4) Many people Iphones underwent Green Screen after the latest update and as their Iphone was not under warranty had to spend 400$ or 11k to 15k depending upon their model for screen repair or change. Meaning Apple company will release update, because of which the Iphone will malfunction and people have to spend money inorder to repair it.5) Iphone - covers, tampered glass are all very expensive and are of third class quality and design. Even after spending 1500 to 2000 INR for an Iphone cover, it will last only for 6-8 months. After that, either it will become dull, dirty or look ugly or pale. An android cover of 250 Rs also functions the same way.6) Apps - That is a total scam everyone knows that.

The notification center can become overwhelming, often leading to many unread notifications that can be easily missed.2. The absence of a back gesture makes navigation less intuitive and can be frustrating for users accustomed to this feature on other devices.3. The camera struggles to focus on small text, making it difficult to capture clear images of detailed documents or fine print.4. When the phone is locked, there's no option to decline incoming calls, which can be inconvenient in various situations.5. The phone's file sharing capabilities are restricted, offering fewer options compared to other devices, which can hinder productivity and convenience.6. The built-in file manager lacks functionality, particularly with no support for app-linked folders, making file organization and access cumbersome.7. Syncing with Google apps, especially Google Drive, isn't seamless and offers limited options, affecting the overall user experience and productivity for those who rely heavily on these services.8. The keyboard's autocorrect feature is always inaccurate and frustrating to use, making it advisable to switch it off for a better typing experience.9. The app placement on the home screen is terrible on the iPhone. Thanks for the update in iOS 18.10. No option to add credit or debit cards on Apple wallet or Google Pay for tap and pay feature.

Feels like 90 fps.3) Display is top notch. Though the screen size could have been bigger.4)Charging is fast as compared to other 20W charging phones.5) Good face unlock feature.6) Great picture quality tho there are some problems i have discussed in cons.6) feels and looks premiumCons:-1) Not android friendly. If u are switching from android, u will find it very difficult to use.2) Sells by the name of privacy, but no privacy features like app lock, lock during calls is available.3) Few apps stop working very often. This maybe just with my device as i have doubts that i have recieved a defective device.4) Slo mo videos lags and skip frames on my device. Will get it check by service center.5)No c type support6) Notification management is very poor.7) lack of fingerprint scanner( only android users)8)file system is very bad . They say that it is so to secure the privacy. But it really sucks.So, if u can go with the cons listed above u can consider it to buy. I will recommend continue to stick to android.

The smartphone marketplace has changed drastically over the span of the past few years. Over the years, it has become more competitive than ever before with a lot of smartphone makers launching their flagship devices every six months. Amid these challenging times Apple, like a bunch of other companies, has maintained a yearly update cycle for its iPhones. In this series, the company, as is customary, announced the iPhone 13 as its successor to last year’s iPhone 12.The newly launched iPhone 13 delivers minor upgrades over the iPhone 12, which includes a smarter camera, a brighter display, a bigger battery and of course, a more advanced processor to name a few. Then there are features like a smaller notch and a less pronounced rear camera module that might seem insignificant compared to the mentioned features but make a world of difference when it comes to usage. Sure, it’s a tad bit heavier than the iPhone 12 but if you compare it with some of the older iPhone models, like the iPhone 11 or the iPhone XR that I have been using, for what seems like aeons now, you will be grateful for everything that the iPhone 13 offers.", "sentiment_label": "positive", "sentiment_score": 0.8, "created_at": "2021-12-22T00:00:00", "country": "Italy"}

The product I received was genuine, and the camera is absolutely lovely, capturing moments with stunning clarity and vividness. Overall, the iPhone 13 delivers a significant upgrade over my previous Android device, and although I was initially skeptical about downgrading from a 120Hz display to 60Hz, the phone's performance feels far from clunky or sluggish.The camera system on the iPhone 13 is nothing short of impressive. It produces stunning images, offering a level of detail and color accuracy.In terms of performance, the iPhone 13 truly shines. Its powerful A15 Bionic chip ensures smooth multitasking, seamless app navigation, and impressive gaming experiences. The device feels snappy and responsive, effortlessly handling resource-intensive tasks. I appreciate the optimized performance that comes with the iPhone 13.Now, let's address the issue that left me somewhat disappointed—the packaging. Considering the price tag of 61,000 INR, one would expect more attention to be paid to the packaging. Unfortunately, the phone arrived in a flimsy packet, which had clearly been subjected to the challenges of long-distance transportation. The iPhone box itself was damaged, but luckily, the phone inside was unharmed. It's disheartening to see such carelessness from the seller Appario Retail when it comes to packaging such an expensive device. I hope this issue can be addressed by the seller to ensure a better customer experience in the future.Despite the packaging mishap, the iPhone 13 has proven to be a remarkable device. If you're looking to switch from Android or upgrade from an older iPhone, the iPhone 13 is definitely worth considering.", "sentiment_label": "positive", "sentiment_score": 1.0, "created_at": "2023-01-07T00:00:00", "country": "Germany"}
{"author": "user_2418", "source": "bestbuy", "message": "Good phone. I’m not a phone fanatic but here is my simple and honest review.As someone who has only used windows and android phones I must say, iPhone is a good upgrade. I do, however, have some issues with the phone. If you are a hard core android user then you WILL face some issues. As in, the fact that iPhone does not have built in call recording feature. In the case of messages, you can reply from the drawer itself but does not have mark as read option. Truecaller absolutely does not work in this phone. I am a premium member on truecaller and it is of no use cause i still get bombarded with spam calls. Dual sim is one nano sim and the other e-sim, no dual tray for both your sim card. I am having issues with screencast/mirroring as well. In short, all the small little things that seems normal and one’s that you’re used to in an android is basically missing in an iPhone. Other than that the phone is great. Camera is great with a lot of features (which I’m still learning). Sound is great. No annoying nudges to keep updating apps. It’ll silently update in the background without the prompt message that it is being updated. Easy to use once you get the hang of it.Update:- i have been using this phone since March’23 so it’s been 2 months now and I have found that this phone is starting to lag a little. Not much, just a little but it is annoying (having spent so much money you’d expect more). Also, even with full network bars i sometimes struggle to get net connection. I have to rely on wifi most of the times and it has become a burden.", "sentiment_label": "positive", "sentiment_score": 1.0, "created_at": "2023-10-04T00:00:00", "country": "Australia"}
{"author": "user_2419", "source": "amazon", "message": "Consistent, dependable & need more customization options. Likes -1. A good display2. Great dual speaker sound quality3. It’s fast. I am using for more than a month and it never hanged.4. Updated to IOS 16 and unlike Android phones it is bug free or has very less bugs5. Long term software & security support (a very few Android phone manufacturers gives 5 years OS support with less bugs)6. Consistent camera. I would say the camera is not so hi fi but takes consistently good photos7. Apps are well optimized. Even google apps like YouTube, Maps, Gmail etc works better in IOS rather than their own proprietary OS8. Widgets in IOS 15 and 16. Android has widgets for decades now but IOS took the user experience to a whole new level.9. The new boxy design (introduced with iPhone 12) is cool and looks good.10. Network & call quality is good.11. Haptic feedback is awesome.Dislikes (Some dislikes are due to myself being an Android user for decades)1. The ugly notch. Though they made a dynamic island with iPhone 14 but lets accept the truth its still ugly compared to the hole punch2. Battery life & charging speed.3. Lack of customization. I can’t place the icons wherever i feel like on the screen.4. Lack of fingerprint scanner. Face id is good but fingerprint scanner is more practical, specially when you pay contactless5. Being an Android user I am used to with swipe from the right edge of the screen to go back. In iPhone this is not working & you need to reach out to actual back buttons of the app.6. Settings app is messy as all installed app would show up on the main page. I would say Android settings app is more sophisticated.7. Lastly the price should’ve been less. With all discounts & all it comes ~60k INR and its costly.Overall I am satisfied switching to iPhone 13 from Android (used OnePlus 6t for 3 years). Last time I switched to iPhone was with iPhone 5S and I couldn’t stay for 6 months and switched to Android again.

{"author": "user_2511", "source": "bestbuy", "message": "The iPhone 13 is the new benchmark for flagship phones...!. We're pretty confident when we say that the iPhone 13 is the best iPhone for most people. It may look like Apple has only changed the position of one of the phone's back cameras since last year's model, but trust us when we say that there are more substantial upgrades than that. With a new display, larger battery, and better camera hardware and software, the iPhone 13 is the new benchmark for flagship phones.Once again, Apple's made the iPhone 13 far more powerful than its Android competitors thanks to its 5G-ready A15 Bionic chip. If the raw performance doesn't interest you, photographers can play with the new Photographic Style filters in the camera app, while videographers will be excited by the new Cinematic mode focus-racking ability.The regular iPhone 13 has some flaws. The charging is still relatively slow compared to some Android phones. And I don't like that only the iPhone 13 Pro models get a 120Hz display and telephoto zoom. But based on my in-depth iPhone 13 review, this new iPhone is the best phone for the money.The overall display quality continues to be stellar. When watching the trailer for The Matrix Resurrections, I was mesmerized by the neon code encircling Neo as he walked down the street, and in another scene, I could make out individual hairs on Neo’s beard as he stared up into the sun.DISPLAY1. Smaller notch makes the display a bit more immersive2. Slightly different button placement3. Pink and blue are standout colors4. New Green color launched March 2022CAMERA1. Bright and colorful images beat Samsung2. Ultra-wide camera delivers more scenes and improved Night mode3. Photographic styles give you creative controlVIDEO1. Cinematic mode automatically changes focus on subjects while adding bokeh2. Superior Dolby Vision HDR video qualityPERFORMANCE and A15 Bionic1.A15 Bionic is the fastest chip once again2. Machine learning performance notably betterBATTERY LIFE1.10 hours and 33 minutes of battery life, which is 2 hours better than the iPhone 12Software1.SharePlay lets you watch videos and listen to music with friends2. Focus cuts down on distractionsVERDICT :The iPhone 13 improves on what was already the best iPhone for most people by introducing a bunch of welcome enhancements. I especially like the longer battery life, as the iPhone 12’s endurance was underwhelming even for a 5G phone. I wouldn’t recommend that iPhone 12 owners upgrade to the new iPhone, but the iPhone 13 is worth it if you own an iPhone 11 or older device.I don’t think many people will care about the smaller notch. What truly stands out on the iPhone 13 is the camera. The low-light performance is even better now, and computational photography features like Cinematic mode and Photographic styles flex the A15 Bionic’s muscles in ways that go way beyond benchmarks.I’m also glad Apple doubled the starting storage at 128GB, as that move was overdue and puts the new iPhone on par with Android flagships. I’d like to see Apple offering faster charging next time around — be it via USB-C or MagSafe — as well as a 120Hz display.The bottom line is that the iPhone 13 is a fantastic phone and raises the bar for what you think a camera phone can do.", "sentiment_label": "positive", "sentiment_score": 1.0, "created_at": "2022-07-27T00:00:00", "country": "India"}

{"author": "user_2679", "source": "blog", "message": "Truly worth the money spent! Even if you go broke!. My honest review after going broke buying this depreciating object.I have been using android phones since the last 10 years and finally decided to switch to iPhone! I used to roast iPhone for its prices, lack of features and also things like power adapter not given in box etc, but my last android phone (iqoo 7 legend) had lot of software related issues and battery issues after updating it to android 12, tired of bugs and software glitches in android, I finally decided to buy a iPhone and switch from android to iOS And Boy Was I right!I never even held an iPhone In my life before because of its price, but now I made a great choice even if I had to spend all my savings on it.iPhone 13 is so smooth that even my IQOO 7 Legend with 120hz feels slower than it even if iPhone has only 60hz. And I can’t believe what I’m seeing, all the games/apps are so much smoother and optimised than on android.I was very sceptical about the charging speed of an iPhone Because in Iqoo I had 66w fast charger where as for iPhone I had to buy 20w separate fast charger for 1800rs, but charging speed isn’t disappointing.Display quality is truly flagship level and I’m quite a fan of the small 6.1 display believe it or not, being able to reach the top of display with just one hand is very helpful, Build quality is great.I would recommend NOT to waste extra 40k for buying 13 pro. Because I don’t think having a extra camera telephoto lens is worth spending 40k.You can see in the 3rd image attached the quality of wide angle camera pic shot on my iPhone 13, wide angle camera struggles in low light, but main camera is really good, captures true colours. Front camera is really good too, truly flagship.Speakers are Great.Battery life is better than my previous devices,iOS is very optimised in terms of battery life, easy 8hrs sot on normal usage.NOTE : While playing BGMI you loose around 2% battery every 6minutes at HD + Extreme Graphics. Which is also good. Pro Max Would Be far better in terms of battery.For the software? Yes I feel like there are few downsides, even if the software is very smooth and has very less bugs, it has two annoying things : any game gets paused when you open control centre just to check the battery etc, Lock Screen is annoying and also having to reach the top left corner just to see notifications is also annoying, clearing all notifications is also very annoying.But other than that a perfect 10/10 purchase. I was very disappointed at myself when I paid for the iPhone but when I received it I was truly happy that I bought it.Truly worth it.", "sentiment_label": "positive", "sentiment_score": 1.0, "created_at": "2022-06-02T00:00:00", "country": "Canada"}

Why man, why.. You don't have any features for Swipe up, just make it easy to launch.3. Andorid Dialer is Always Missed: Every android has a basic feature, where you can search the contact directly from Phone Dialer, here Dialer is used for Dialing Number only and it will not suggest you similar contact from contacts or last Dial. This is really bad.. If you have to Dial a number directly, use Dialer.. If you have to dial someone from Recent Call log, shift to that and if you to dial someone from contact, shift to that. Man, all this can be done under one button, under dialer. Android user will miss this very badly.4. Sending Multiple Files in Whatsapp: If you wants to add more than 1 file directly from whatsapp, you have to do it twice. In Android, one can simple start selecting from whatspp itself and can select as many files as they wants and can send in a single click. Here for sending multiple files, you have to go to gallery or folder and select all files first and share it through whatsapp.5.

Contact Viewing: Contact list sorting method is still out of my mind. Man, make it easy. For example, if one of your contacts First Name or Middle Name or Last Name, any one of thing start with Alphabet \"A\", than it will be shown on top of the list.

It’s clear that this phone is built for speed and efficiency.### CameraThe camera system on the iPhone 13 is a standout feature. The 12MP wide and ultra-wide lenses capture stunning photos with great detail and color accuracy. Low-light performance is particularly impressive, thanks to the sensor-shift optical image stabilization. The new Photographic Styles and Cinematic mode are fantastic additions, allowing for creative freedom and professional-looking videos.### Battery LifeBattery life has been a pleasant surprise. I easily get through a full day of use on a single charge, even with heavy usage. The efficiency of the A15 Bionic chip and the slightly larger battery make a noticeable difference compared to previous models.### SoftwareiOS 15 is smooth and intuitive. The new features like Focus modes, enhanced FaceTime capabilities, and improved privacy controls make the user experience even better. Everything feels well-integrated and easy to use.### Overall ImpressionThe iPhone 13 has exceeded my expectations. It offers a perfect balance of performance, design, and innovative features.

{"author": "user_2718", "source": "twitter", "message": "Review after 1 week of usage. Got it for 65K on Amazon prime day. So as a lifelong android user I have switched to IOS. So will be dividing this into the pros and negs:Product red 128GBPros:1) Received genuine product from Amazon( was quite sceptic about it though)2) Built quality excellent3) Camera quality excellent. True to life color reproduction, Indoor conditions amazing, night photos are good, facial tones are very good, day clicks are amazing. In short it's an amazing exp. Selfie cam also produces very good quality images. And also no shift in dynamic range while shifting B/W wide and ultra wide cams.4) Display:- Its a really great display, not 120 hz, but the experience is no less than a 120 hz, coz of apple's great software optimization, buttery smooth, no jitters on the screen, won't feel like a 60 hz panel. Now the notch, yes it will be bothering a little bit but its got its own functions, face unlock and stuff (works great in all environmental conditions)after a little while you get adjusted and it got its own magic functions like when when the phone rings and you go close to it, it detects your presence and lowers the vol level.5) Performance: Most powerful processor in the world.6) Battery:- With light usage will easily go for 2 days and with heavy 1 day. Remember to follow a charging pattern and it will give a solid battery exp.7) Speakers: Very loud with a small thumpCons:1) To keep photos and stuff you need to buy storage. 5 GB by default but that's nothing. Download google photos as an alternate sol. if you don't wanna buy storage.2) File management system sucks, android is much better.3) It has dolby atmos but for that you need a subscription to Apple music.4) Does not have a telephoto cam, which I think is a must at this price point.5) Somehow I am not getting 4g+ on my airtel, don't know why but in my android phone always used to get that.6) No USB C7) Siri is dumb AF8) Apple maps are not good, so download Google maps.9) Google keypad is much better than apple's.10) Notification panel and those small things like typing in the notification panel and other things that you can do in android is much much better than apple.11) As of now no haptic feedback while typing maybe coming on IOS 16Note:- Apple ecosystem still exploring that part but whenever you click any pic it automatically gets updated and I can see it in my Macbook also.Overall I would say if you are planning to buy a phone for responsiveness and does the everyday stuff without any hanging problems and stuff then buy it, and also if you are planning to keep it for a long time, then I think its a good investment for the future. Its got Great resale value.Hope this helps in making your decision easier.Update after 2 weeks of usage:All the above points remains the same, but I did check out the ecosystem and the experience has been amazing.1) I can receive and make phone calls (cellular calls) from my macbook, and the call quality is also good.So basically you can keep your phone in some other section of the house and you are working with your macbook somewhere else and if some call comes you can receive that on your macbook. PS:- your phone and macbook should be connected to a similar network, i.e wi-fi.2) Airplay- Just from the lock screen itself i can play any video and also listen to music from my phone. So basically you can watch youtube amazon prime videos(app not in the macbook but present on phone) and other stuff and also listen to music, and the switch of devices is also seamless. So someone in my house can use my macbook to watch movies on amazon prime(playing from my phone) and I can browse linkedin or FB from my iphone.", "sentiment_label": "positive", "sentiment_score": 0.8, "created_at": "2022-07-30T00:00:00", "country": "Spain"}

{"author": "user_2728", "source": "reddit", "message": "Not a great phone!. I switched from Oneplus 5t to iPhone 13. The reasons I switched was 1. Battery life of Oneplus 5t deteriorated rapidly and OnePlus hardly cared to explain this. I also suspected that OnePlus deliberately created a bug that led to sudden drop in battery life. 2. Wanted to get an Android phone but could not find even one decent phone that did not have heating issues. 3. Oneplus device also suffered from Screenburn.Having switched the battery life is sorted and the phone does not have any heating issues but iPhones lack basic features such as1. Display of date and time on status bar2. The rounded edges of the phone create a problem as some apps with options at the bottom of the screen are not properly displayed.3. Amazon App does not allow purchase if Kindle books on iOS devices.4. Typing is a problem as the screen is smaller compared to a OnePlus device.Overall, I am neither too happy nor too sad with the purchase though I must confess that price of the phone seems exorbitant vis a vis the value delivered.", "sentiment_label": "neutral", "sentiment_score": 0.6, "created_at": "2022-02-20T00:00:00", "country": "China"}

Doesn’t even have history for the ongoing transaction, forget about storing previous transactions.No option to record calls while the other person can record you.WhatsApp for iOS can’t do strikethrough nor monospace.  Forward & share options are quite time consuming. You can’t edit status privacy after you’ve selected the media files (photos/videos) to be uploaded. I’m mentioning features of WhatsApp because it’s an app that is used by most iPhone users in India!There are some good things about iPhone 13 which include:• A toggle switch to quickly silence the phone.• Battery Life is good.• Display: doesn’t cause strain on eyes too easily.• Picture Quality is good in broad daylight but they are a tone darker than real.

The Apple iPhone 13 (256GB) in Pink offers a combination of elegant design, solid performance, and advanced features. Here’s a detailed review:### Design and BuildThe iPhone 13 in Pink sports a sleek and refined design with flat edges, a ceramic shield front cover, and aerospace-grade aluminum edges. The Pink color option is soft and subtle, making it an attractive choice for those who prefer a pastel look. The device feels premium in hand, and its compact size makes it comfortable to use one-handed.### DisplayThe 6.1-inch Super Retina XDR display is vibrant and sharp, providing excellent color accuracy and contrast. Whether you’re streaming videos, browsing photos, or playing games, the display offers a rich visual experience. The smaller notch compared to previous models also allows for slightly more screen real estate.### PerformancePowered by the A15 Bionic chip, the iPhone 13 delivers fast and efficient performance. Whether you’re multitasking, gaming, or using resource-intensive apps, the device handles everything smoothly. The 256GB storage variant provides ample space for apps, media, and files, making it a good option for users who require more storage.### CameraThe dual-camera system features a 12MP wide and a 12MP ultra-wide lens. The cameras perform exceptionally well in various lighting conditions, producing detailed and vibrant photos. The improved low-light performance and Night mode make it possible to capture clear images even in dim settings. The new Photographic Styles feature allows for customization of the tone and color of your photos without compromising on the overall quality.### Battery LifeThe iPhone 13 offers improved battery life compared to its predecessor. With moderate use, the device can easily last a full day on a single charge. The introduction of smart data modes, which switch between 5G and LTE depending on your usage, also helps in conserving battery.### SoftwareRunning on iOS 15, the iPhone 13 brings a range of new features and enhancements, such as Focus mode, redesigned notifications, and improved FaceTime capabilities. The user interface is smooth and intuitive, making it easy to navigate through apps and settings.### Additional Features- **5G Connectivity:** Offers faster download and upload speeds, improving the overall browsing and streaming experience.- **MagSafe Compatibility:** The device supports MagSafe accessories, allowing for easy attachment of chargers, wallets, and other accessories.- **Water and Dust Resistance:** The iPhone 13 is rated IP68, meaning it can withstand being submerged in water up to 6 meters for 30 minutes.### ConclusionThe iPhone 13 (256GB) in Pink is a solid choice for those looking for a stylish and powerful smartphone. It combines top-tier performance with a beautiful display, excellent camera capabilities, and long battery life. While it may not be a massive upgrade for users of the iPhone 12, it still offers enough enhancements to be a worthy investment for those using older models or wanting the latest features.", "sentiment_label": "positive", "sentiment_score": 1.0, "created_at": "2024-09-08T00:00:00", "country": "Brazil"}

But anyone with an iPhone 11 or older will find enough new parts and features to consider the new modelsScreenThe screen is notably better than last year's. It's the first iPhone with Apple's ProMotion display, a very high refresh-rate screen technology that was introduced on the iPad Pro in 2017.The screen can adjust to the content on the page to help save battery life and make things feel smoother. If you're just reading a website, for example, it might refresh less frequently and save battery life. But then if you're gaming or scrolling through a long webpage, it'll refresh really fast to make everything much smoother.BatteryBattery life is top-notch and lasts longer than any other iPhone on the market. Unless you're playing games for hours and hoursThat's thanks to a combination of a newer processor, a new screen and a bigger battery. I streamed nine hours of movies, for example, with just over 50% brightness, and still had more than half the battery left.CameraThe regular wide-angle, the zoom and the ultra-wide-angle lenses on the back now allow in more light, which means they're better at taking pictures in the dark.The HDR feature is also better in situations where your subject might have a lot of light behind them, which can normally make people in a picture look dark — all the iPhone 13 phones can keep color and detail even if the sun is right behind someone.You can get really close to an object, like a blueberry or a flower, and capture a lot of detail.", "sentiment_label": "positive", "sentiment_score": 1.0, "created_at": "2021-09-25T00:00:00", "country": "Italy"}

Yes the battery, camera, and storage is way better. That much is true. But the build quality? It's hit and miss. Reception Is meh but that could be the SIM card. I've had budget android phones that get full LTE reception where my 13 will have one bar. But again that could just be my SIM card on it's way out. Something about certain aspects of the phone feel much cheaper than bits of it's predecessor. For example the rear glass. Yes it's supposedly the same ceramic shield from the 12 but I've found it scratches much easier for no real reason. Another example is the speaker grille in the front notch. It looks alot cheaper and sounds that way too than the one in the 12. Pretty tinny and just rattley sounding. It's not a horrible phone. It's the first iPhone I've felt like I can get android style utility from. But the questionable build quality changes over the previous generation just stifle it for no reason. That's not to say the phone is entirely built out of meh. For example the camera lenses and the bump are much bigger on the new 13. I work as a mechanic and subjected my old 12 to the same rigors. The 12 took it like a champ aside from very light camera lenses scratching. I've subjected the 13 to much more stress and it just shrugs it off aside from the seemingly unexplainable rear glass scratches. I haven't dropped it like my 12 yet so theres always that. But if it's anything like the 12 it'll take a few hip height falls onto concrete with no issue. I'd be so bold as to call this the \"sweet spot\" for the whole iPhone lineage. good focus on where it matters.

My advice is it’s a highly paid model, so use it minimum 3 years.", "sentiment_label": "positive", "sentiment_score": 0.8, "created_at": "2021-10-16T00:00:00", "country": "USA"}

This was my first iPhone purchase and it was working fine for 1.5 years - although I had complains about the battery life which kept getting worse with time to the point that I had to carry a power bank with me always.Randomly one day out of the blue, the phone crashed & now it's not turning on - when I took it to the service centre they said it's due to motherboard issue and it will cost us 40k to replace it. My phone is prime condition, I have not dropped it, there is not even a scratch on it. I wonder how there can be a hardware issue while it was working fine just few moments before crash. Also, this happened a few days after I installed iOS 17 - so that is also a suspect.", "sentiment_label": "negative", "sentiment_score": 0.2, "created_at": "2023-03-10T00:00:00", "country": "India"}

It is definitely defective or from very old stock. And Amazon is not allowing for a refund for this product as well. No replace/refund - but option is available. It’s just a way to defraud buyers.
